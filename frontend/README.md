# Shortlist web app

TanStack Start (React 19, Vite) frontend for Shortlist. It talks to the Express API in `../backend` through a
typed client generated from the API's OpenAPI spec.

## Run locally

Start the backend first (see `../backend/README.md`), then:

```sh
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env   # defaults point at http://localhost:4000
pnpm dev               # http://localhost:3000
```

Sign in with "Continue as guest" (shown in development), or with Google or GitHub once their OAuth apps are set
up in the backend. To see the admin dashboard, sign in with an email listed in the backend's `ADMIN_EMAILS`.

| `pnpm api:types`              | Regenerate `src/lib/api/schema.d.ts` from `../backend/openapi.json` after API changes |

## Design

- Light mode is the default for everyone until they pick a theme in the account menu.
- Light mode is a cool paper grey, not white; dark mode is a green-tinted charcoal. Tokens live in `src/styles.css`.
- Accent is fountain-pen teal; the highlighter color marks AI changes. No purple.
- Fonts: Source Serif 4 for headings, Hanken Grotesk for the interface, JetBrains Mono in the LaTeX editor.
- Template previews in `public/templates` are real renders from the backend's templates.
- UI work follows the `ui-ux-pro-max` skill's checks (contrast, focus states, touch targets, empty states).

## Analytics

With `VITE_POSTHOG_KEY` set, the app sends page views and links them to the signed-in user's id. Session replay
masks every piece of text and every input, so no resume content is recorded. Signing out resets the PostHog
identity.

## Deploy

Vercel builds every push to `main` (project root `frontend`, preset from `vercel.json`). Set these on the Vercel
project:

| Variable            | Production value              |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `VITE_API_URL`      | `https://api.shortlist.co.in` |
| `VITE_SITE_URL`     | `https://shortlist.co.in`     |
| `VITE_POSTHOG_KEY`  | PostHog project token         |
| `VITE_POSTHOG_HOST` | `https://us.i.posthog.com`    |

The API sets its session cookie on the shared parent domain (`COOKIE_DOMAIN=.shortlist.co.in` in the backend),
so `shortlist.co.in` and `api.shortlist.co.in` share the sign-in. `www.shortlist.co.in` permanently redirects to
`shortlist.co.in`.
