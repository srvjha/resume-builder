              A fresher resume has one job: get you shortlisted for an
              interview. Recruiters spend well under a minute on a first read,
              and most use an applicant tracking system (ATS) to search and sort
              applications. The format below works for both.

            <p>
              An applicant tracking system (ATS) is the software companies use
              to collect applications. Workday, Greenhouse, Lever,
              SuccessFactors and Naukri RMS are common ones. When you apply, the
              ATS reads your resume and fills fields like name, email, job
              titles, dates, education and skills. Recruiters then search and
              filter those fields, and many systems rank applicants against the
              job.
            </p>
            <p>
              Most of the time, an ATS does not reject resumes on its own.
              Rejections usually come from knockout questions on the application
              form (location, notice period, years of experience) or from a
              recruiter who never finds you in a search. So the goal has two
              parts: a resume the ATS reads correctly, and one that matches the
              words a recruiter searches for.

            <li>
              <strong>Use one column.</strong> Many parsers read straight across
              the page, so two columns can come out as lines from both sides
              mixed together.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Use standard headings:</strong> Education, Experience,
              Projects, Skills. Clever names like "My Journey" may not be
              recognised as a section.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Keep contact details in the main body</strong>, not in the

            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Avoid text in images, icons and text boxes.</strong> A
              phone icon with no number written next to it reads as nothing, or

            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Avoid tables for important content.</strong> A simple
              education table usually parses fine; a full layout built from
              tables often does not.

            an empty page. Export again from Word, Google Docs or LaTeX. Send a

              your resume, in the same words, wherever they are true for you. If

              different, and a recruiter reading 200 applications decides in
              seconds whether yours fits. Applicant tracking systems (ATS) make
              this stricter: recruiters search them for the skills in the job
              post, and a resume that never uses those words does not come up.

              <li>
                <strong>Must-haves:</strong> skills and qualifications the post

              If the post says <strong>REST APIs</strong> and your resume says
              "backend services", a recruiter searching for REST APIs will miss
              you. For every must-have you genuinely have, use the job's exact
              wording at least once:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                In your <strong>skills</strong> section, so it is found in a
                search.
              </li>
              <li>
                In a <strong>bullet</strong>, so it is backed by something you
                did. A skill that appears only in a list is easy to doubt.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Do not paste keywords in white text or repeat them ten times.
              Recruiters read the resume after the search, and keyword stuffing
              is obvious to a person.

            <p>
              Nobody expects an internship applicant to have work experience;
              that is what the internship is for. A recruiter hiring an intern
              is looking for three things:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Proof you can build or do something</strong> in the
                field, even on a small scale.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Signs you learn quickly</strong>: things you picked up
                on your own, and how far you took them.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>The basics</strong>: your degree, year, college and the
                skills the role needs.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Everything on your resume should support one of these. That is why
              projects and achievements matter more than a long list of
              certificates.

              Without an internship, projects do the job that work experience
              does on other resumes. Pick two or three, with the one closest to
              the internship first, and write each like a job:
            </p>
            <ul>

                <strong>The problem:</strong> what it does and for whom.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>How:</strong> the tools you used, named specifically.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>The result:</strong> users, speed, accuracy, or simply
                that it is live and in use.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>A link:</strong> GitHub or a live demo, so they can see
                it.
              </li>

                <strong>Weak:</strong> "Made a weather app using React."
              </li>
              <li>

            </ul>
            <p>
