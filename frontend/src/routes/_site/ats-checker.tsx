    q: 'What is an ATS?',
    a: 'An applicant tracking system is the software companies use to collect applications. It reads your resume into fields like name, experience and skills so recruiters can search and filter candidates. If it cannot read part of your resume, that part may never reach a person.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Is this the score employers see?',
    a: 'No. There is no universal ATS score. Every company uses different software, set up in its own way. This score estimates how cleanly a typical ATS can read your resume and how easy it is for a recruiter to scan, so you know what to fix.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Will an ATS reject my resume automatically?',
    a: "Rarely. Real ATS software ranks applicants for each job instead of rejecting them. What filters candidates out is knockout questions on the application form (like location, work authorization or years of experience), recruiters searching for keywords, and per-job match tiers. So the useful goal is a resume that parses cleanly, matches the job's must-have skills, and answers its knockout requirements. This checker looks at all three.",
  },
  {
    q: 'Will you keep my resume?',
    a: 'No. A PDF is read in your browser and only its text, with where each piece sits on the page, is sent to be checked. It is scored and then discarded, and nothing is saved to an account.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Why does my PDF show no text?',
    a: 'It was probably scanned or exported as an image. Most ATS software cannot read those either. Export the PDF again from Word, Google Docs or LaTeX so the text can be selected, or paste the text instead.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How is the score worked out?',
    a: 'With fixed rules, not AI, so the same resume always gets the same score. It looks at things like contact details, standard section headings, bullet length, numbers in your bullets and overall length. A PDF is also read the way an ATS parser reads it, to catch columns, contact details in the page header and icon fonts. Add a job description to see which of its must-have and other skills you are missing, how your title compares, and which requirements a recruiter will check. Skills are matched using data from O*NET and ESCO.',
